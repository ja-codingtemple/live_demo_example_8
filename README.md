# Starter Code: Advanced Python Module Project (Defeat the Evil Wizard)

In this repository you have two options for starter code:
1. The folder named ``original_starter_code``: In this folder, all the code is in one file.
2. The folder named ``alternative_starter_code`` In this folder, the code is separated into two files. One contains all the classes, one contains game logic and imports the classes. This example is more complete and is a better head start.

# What you have to do to complete this project
- Implement the heal() method in your Character class.
- Randomize the damage in your attack() method in the Character class.
- Create two custom classes of your choice. These must extend the Character class. This means they must be subclasses of Character. (If you use the alternative_starter_code, technically you only need to create 1 more, as I created one called Rogue for you.)
- Create two special abilities for each custom class you create. Do this by implementing a special_ability() method for your custom classes.
- Make sure to implement the special_ability() method for the Mage class, and also for the Fighter class if it's not already implemented. (IF you use alternative_starter_code, it's implemented for Fighter already.)
- Make sure to update your create_character() function to return an instance of each of these custom classes when the player selects them.

# To run this program
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open terminal.
3. Navigate into the project folder. You can use the change directory command ``cd`` to do this.
4. Navigate into the ``/alternative_starter_code`` folder with ``cd``
4. Type ``python filename.py`` If the file is called ``game_logic.py`` you would run ``python game_logic.py``
